Designing and implementing a gender recognition system through voice analysis using Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques to enhance accuracy and efficiency in gender classification.Gender recognition using voice is a fascinating field of study that focuses on the development of algorithms and techniques to identify the gender of a speaker based on their vocal characteristics.
Voice signals carry distinct characteristics that differentiate between male and female speakers. These differences include fundamental frequency (pitch), formant frequencies (resonance frequencies of the vocal tract), and other acoustic features like voice quality and duration.
